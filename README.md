# Spyfall Game v2
 This game offers the opportunity to step into the shoes of both a spy, who is close to having his identity exposed, and the special agent who is hot on the spy's trail. Bluffs, suspicions, probing questions and clever answers are all part of the game!  Spyfall is a unique, conversation-based game. Players have just a few minutes to identify the spy in one of different locations – a hotel, a supermarket, a submarine, and so on. Observation, concentration, indifference and cunning – you will need all of these to be the winner
